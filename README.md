# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub

Hi there!

I am passionate about data science, embedded systems, computer programming, web app development, responsive web design, UX/UI design and mobile app development.
I like to hang around with fellow Campers at http://freecodecamp.com - in the chat rooms. It's a nice place where Campers learn full stack JavaScript.
